The challenge they face is that these message brokers are tightly integrated with several of their mission-critical applications. Amazon MQ is a managed ActiveMQ service running on AWS. In this session, we explore an approach to building a bridge solution from IBM MQ to Amazon MQ. The solution provides a phased nondisruptive approach that customers can adopt to migrate their applications to the cloud and use Amazon MQ as the message broker. We also explore options on benchmarking performance of Amazon MQ broker based on customer requirements. Please bring your laptop.

## API301: Securing data in serverless applications and messaging services 

In this chalk talk, we walk you through the process of designing a serverless application that secures customer data sent to the cloud. The design uses features recently introduced by Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), including AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys for encrypting messages at rest and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints powered by AWS PrivateLink for sending messages without traversing the public internet. These techniques are security best practices for systems that deal with private data, such as e-commerce orders, candidate resumes, or employee information.

## API305-R1: Building serverless machine-learning workflows 

Modern machine-learning workflows leverage AWS services such as Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Comprehend to extract, validate, mutate, and enrich your data. Some drive transactional systems that use ML to generate metadata, others derive insights by visualizing customer-interaction sentiment. All share a common challenge: orchestrating a combination of sequential and parallel steps fulfilled by independent microservices. Join us as we examine how workflows can be used to manage that orchestration in a way that's scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain and run. We contrast two approaches for creating such workflows: a traditional monolithic approach and a serverless approach utilizing AWS Step Functions.

In this session, we present several business use cases for Step Functions, along with implementation patterns, including decoupling, eternal processes, and approval emails.

## API312: How to select the right application-integration service 

Sometimes, architects are unsure about the right application-integration tool or protocol for their use case. To begin with, there is messaging vs. streaming. But even when we're clear about that, there are several different protocols and tools for each category. In this chalk talk, we introduce a decision tree to help you select the right messaging or streaming tool for your architecture. We also discuss real-world scenarios provided by the audience. Bring your challenges and leave this session with a solid understanding of when to use what in messaging and streaming.

## API313: Nondisruptive strategies for application migration 

Many companies want to refactor applications to increase agility, but they face the challenge of migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud first. This is especially challenging for mission-critical applications, where any downtime has a major customer or business impact. In this session, we dive into common application-migration challenges and nondisruptive approaches, including hybrid architectures, that minimize the impact that migration has on existing applications. We review common on-premises message-broker vendors, like IBM MQ and RabbitMQ, and the benefits of using a managed broker like Amazon MQ as part of a migration strategy.

## API315-R3: Application integration patterns for microservices 

One of the implications of applying the microservices architectural style is that a lot of communication between components is done over the network. In order to achieve the promises of microservices, this communication needs to happen in a loosely coupled manner. In this session, we discuss some fundamental application integration patterns mostly based on messaging and connect them to real-world use cases in a microservices scenario. We also point out some benefits that asynchronous messaging can have over REST APIs for communication between microservices.

## ARC314-R2: Decoupled microservices: Building scalable applications 

Often, when the microservices architecture style is applied, much of the communication between components is done over the network. In order to achieve the promises of microservices, this communication needs to happen in a loosely coupled manner. One frequently used option is to have all services expose an API following the REST architectural style. However, there is another option that provides even looser coupling: asynchronous messaging. In this workshop, you learn how to use AWS messaging services to build decoupled microservices architectures to achieve massive scale.

## ARC315-R1: Build end-to-end governance with AWS Control Tower
